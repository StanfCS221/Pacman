# Pacman
Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. This specific repo is focused on using AI agent to play games. Modelling Pacman as a game (duuuuuh), using Minimax to come up with an optimal strategy, using AlphaBeta pruning to lower the number of successor states considered. Using Expectimax algorithm to make Pacman make more risky decisions if benefits are great enough.
