# Pacman
Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. My part of code is in 'submission.py' file between 'BEGIN_YOUR_CODE' and 'END_YOUR_CODE'. Tests can be executed by running 'grader.py' file. More information about the assignment can be found by opening 'index.html' file. Solutions to the written part of the assignments are not published but I am happy to discuss them in person. This specific repo is focused on using AI agent to play games. Modelling Pacman as a game (duuuuuh), using Minimax to come up with an optimal strategy, using AlphaBeta pruning to lower the number of successor states considered. Using Expectimax algorithm to make Pacman make more risky decisions if benefits are great enough.
